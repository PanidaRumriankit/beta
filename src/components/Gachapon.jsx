    question: 'What are the required courses for this branch?',
    answer: 'For freshmen it is required to learn the general engineering courses such as "Engineering Mathematics I", "General Physics I" and "Physics Lab I". You will also need to apply for essential Computer Engineering courses such as, "Computer Programming I" and "Discrete Mathematics and Algebra". For Computer Programming I, you will get to learn the fundamentals of programming with Python. For Discrete Mathematics and Algebra, you will learn about the basic of discrete mathematics and algebra, which is essential for programming.'
